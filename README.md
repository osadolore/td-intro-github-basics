you have a repository where all project files,codes,executiion files are save.where you have programs you want to disable because you dont want it to run ,but then you do not want to delet it for future reference you can decide to save it here for future retrieval. you can clone a your directory and share amongst your team mates so each one can have access or work when you are offline or somewhere else. you can make a branch,like different folder of the repositories and share where each person can list,create,or even delete you can commit,that is making changes or updating whats already on your repository. you can merge files/branches histories together you can decide to even switch branches ,where one person can work,edit,make corrections. collaborate with teammates makes project efficient and help with workflows.it is safe to say github helps protect source codes from catastrophy.
